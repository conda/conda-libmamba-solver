### Docs

* Updated documentation to reflect that the cudatoolkit/cpuonly issue has returned.

### Other

* The `cpuonly` mutex no longer correctly prevents CUDA packages from being
  installed. For a time it appeared to work when non-cuda systems showed a
  virtual package `__cuda=0=0`, but with no `__cuda` package the mutex appears
  to no longer work. Reversing (#131 via #741)
