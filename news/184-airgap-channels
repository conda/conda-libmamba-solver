### Enhancements

* Provide a `CONDA_LIBMAMBA_SOLVER_NO_CHANNELS_FROM_INSTALLED` environment variable to prevent
  channels from being injected from installed packages. This is useful for air-gapped environments
  where outside channels are not available. (#108 via #184)

### Bug fixes

* Ensure unauthenticated channels are not re-injected in the channel lists from installed packages
  if an authenticated equivalent is already present. (#108 via #184)
