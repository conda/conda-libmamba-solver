### Bug fixes

* Port logic from [conda/conda#9614](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/9614), which fixes
  a bug where the `--prune` flag was not working correctly in `conda env update` commands.
  (#270)
* Ensure environments are not aggressively updated to higher priority channels under some conditions. (#240 via #270)
