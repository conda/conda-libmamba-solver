### Enhancements

* Support sharded repodata [CEP 16](https://conda.org/learn/ceps/cep-0016) when
  enabled by a flag or environment variable. When sharded repodata is enabled,
  the solver will check every channel for an index,
  "repodata_shards.msgpack.zst", and re-checks every 7 days if not found. It
  builds a subset of repodata by recursively traversing the dependencies of all
  installed and requested packages, using shards to fetch only the package
  metadata that could possibly be part of the solution from each channel. This
  smaller amount of package metadata is sent to the solver. Sharded repodata can
  save a significant amount of bandwidth and memory when installing packages.
  (#684)
* Shards are cached in a sqlite database in
  $(CONDA_PREFIX)/pkgs/cache/repodata_shards.db
* This implementation does not use shards for "conda search" or other repodata
  uses that do not include a solve.
