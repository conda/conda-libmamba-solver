### Enhancements

* Name-only pins will lock the corresponding package if installed. ([conda#13031](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/13031) via #289)

### Bug fixes

* Do not crash if a `MatchSpec` with a build string is specified in the CLI and there's a pinned spec for the same package name. (#286 via #289)

### Deprecations

* Users won't be able to override pinned specs with incompatible CLI specs anymore. Instead they must modify their pinned specs explicitly. ([conda#9016](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9016) via #289, #294)

### Docs

* Document intentional deviations from conda's `classic` solver behavior. (#289)
