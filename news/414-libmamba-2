### Enhancements

* Update integrations to use `libmamba` 2.0. (#414)

### Bug fixes

* Drop error-prone `noarch` type inference, which caused installation issues in `noarch: python` packages that did not specify `python` as a runtime dependency. This information is now properly returned by `libmamba`. ([conda#13412](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/13412) via #414)
