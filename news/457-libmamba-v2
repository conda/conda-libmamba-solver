### Enhancements

* Require `libmambapy` v2. This is a big refactor in `libmamba` internals, which allowed us to remove a lot of code in `conda-libmamba-solver` too. (#457)

### Bug fixes

* <news item>

### Deprecations

* `CONDA_LIBMAMBA_SOLVER_NO_CHANNELS_FROM_INSTALLED` has no effect anymore. Channels coming from installed packages are no longer added to the channel list. (#411 via #457)
* Removed `conda_libmamba_solver.state.BaseIndexHelper`. The base class is now `conda_libmamba_solver.index.IndexHelper`. (#457)
* Verbose logging in `libsolv` has a big overhead in `libmamba` v2, so we have disabled it by default (even if the user adds `-vvv` flags to the CLI). To opt-in, please set `CONDA_LIBMAMBA_SOLVER_DEBUG_LIBSOLV` to a truthy value. (#457)
* Python 3.8 is no longer supported. The minimum version is now 3.9. (#457)
