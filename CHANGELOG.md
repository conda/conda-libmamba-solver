[//]: # (current developments)

## 23.11.1 (2023-11-16)

### Enhancements

* Raise a friendlier `InvalidSpec` error instead of `RuntimeError` when libmamba detects a problem in the configured solver jobs. (#352 via #357)
* Ensure specs, `SolverInputState.installed` and `SolverInputState.virtual` containers are consistently sorted. (#378)

### Bug fixes

* Configure pinned specs just once to avoid solver bugs related with their persistence (i.e. inability to downgrade environments if pinned specs are present and a transient dependency needs to be removed). (#354 via #355)
* Detect whether a channel is part of a multichannel so the latter is used in the `PackageRecord` entries for conda-build. Fixes an issue with conda-build and custom multichannels. (#363 via #365)
* Allow authenticated URLs in `default_channels` and other multichannels. (#364 via #366)
* Preserve authentication while reloading local channels. (#366)

## 23.11.0 (2023-11-02)

### Bug fixes

* Do not use `libmamba`'s default signal handler so users can `Ctrl-C` from `conda`. (#337 via #340)
* Defer conda-build-specific exception definition and import until it is needed by the solver. (#342)
* Interpret "excluded by strict priority" solver errors as proper satisfiability conflicts and avoid printing related yet uninformative warnings. (#343)
* Ensure that historic specs are kept in the environment, even if that means raising a conflict. (#341 via #345)

### Docs

* Document environment variables used for advanced configuration. (#349)

### Other

* Require `libmambapy >=1.5.3` for improved signal handling and `MatchSpec` syntax compliance. (#347)

* @jaimergp



## 23.9.3 (2023-10-24)

### Bug fixes

* Massage bracket-containing specs (e.g. `ca-certificates[version='>=2023']`) so they are understood by `libmambapy.Query`, fixing a bug where `conda` would erroneously complain about no package records matching the configured pinned specs. (#327 via #328)

### Contributors

* @jaimergp



## 23.9.2 (2023-10-19)

### Bug fixes

* Use the conda version reported at runtime (instead of the one reported by `conda list`) to figure out whether there are conda updates available. (#316)
* Allow the index to be empty in `--offline` runs with no local cache available for the configured channels. (#323)

### Contributors

* @jaimergp



## 23.9.1 (2023-09-29)

### Enhancements

* Increase performance of `notify_conda_outdated` logic. (#298)

### Bug fixes

* Prevent solver from bouncing between two compatible solutions when the same command is run twice in a row. (#302)

### Contributors

* @costrouc
* @jaimergp



## 23.9.0 (2023-09-28)

### Enhancements

* Expose libmamba's `repoquery` search features as a conda subcommand plugin. (#258)
* Rewrite how we create tasks for `libsolv`, making use of `libmamba`'s `add_pin` features. Requires `libmambapy >=1.5.1`. (#270, #288)
* Name-only pins will lock the corresponding package if installed. ([conda#13031](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/13031) via #289)
* Use the `.solv` cache for repodata if available and recent. (#295)

### Bug fixes

* Handle commands with no channels passed gracefully. (#256)
* Workaround for missing `noarch` field in returned `PackageRecord` payload. (#257)
* Port logic from [conda/conda#9614](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/9614), which fixes
  a bug where the `--prune` flag was not working correctly in `conda env update` commands.
  (#270)
* Ensure environments are not aggressively updated to higher priority channels under some conditions. (#240 via #270, #285)
* Do not inject those channels from installed packages that do not exist or are unavailable. (#262 via #274)
* Correctly print all configured channels in `PackagesNotFoundError` exceptions. (#284)
* Do not crash if a `MatchSpec` with a build string is specified in the CLI and there's a pinned spec for the same package name. (#286 via #289)
* Only apply `defaults::pkg` workarounds for the default value `default_channels`. (#292)

### Deprecations

* Users won't be able to override pinned specs with incompatible CLI specs anymore. Instead they must modify their pinned specs explicitly. ([conda#9016](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9016) via #289, #294)

### Docs

* Document intentional deviations from conda's `classic` solver behavior. (#289)

### Other

* Explain why `defaults::pkg_name` is broken libmamba 1.5.x ([details](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba/issues/2431)). (#266)



## 23.7.0 (2023-07-31)

### Enhancements

* Add basic integrations for local channels in conda-build. (#194)

### Bug fixes

* Add backwards-compatible support for the new namespaced settings in `libmamba.Context`. (#192 via #193)
* Fixes an error where a user-supplied package in the CLI would get dropped if the argument happened to match a larger string in the argument list. (#221 via #222)
* Fix authentication in package downloads. (#216 via #226)
* Fix unhandled channels coming from injected virtual packages in `conda-lock`. (#230 via #234)
* Handle URL-encoded channels correctly with recent `libmamba` versions. (#247 via #248)

### Docs

* Added notes about development workflows with libmamba from source. (#191)

### Other

* Adding libmamba/libmambapy as development dependencies within docker images. (#191)

## 23.5.0 (2023-05-25)

### Enhancements

* Provide a `CONDA_LIBMAMBA_SOLVER_NO_CHANNELS_FROM_INSTALLED` environment variable to prevent
  channels from being injected from installed packages. This is useful for air-gapped environments
  where outside channels are not available. (#108 via #184)
* Simplify `libmambapy.Context` initialization so we only set the bits that we use. (#209)
* Use the new `RepoInterface` and remove the `SubdirData` subclass workarounds, which requires `conda 23.5.0`.
  (#210)

### Bug fixes

* Fix an issue where running `conda update <package>` would result in the package being _downgraded_ if no newer versions were available. (#71 via #158)
* Ensure unauthenticated channels are not re-injected in the channel lists from installed packages
  if an authenticated equivalent is already present. (#108 via #184)
* Honor `context.repodata_threads`. (#200)
* Do not set `quiet` manually when `context.json` is true. (#187)

### Deprecations

* Remove unneeded user-agent tests. (#183)

### Docs

* Document known solver behavior differences. (#115, #131 via #197)
* Update development docs to reflect changes in build system and other inaccuracies. (#208)

### Other

* Add tests reproducing the known solver differences. (#115, #131 via #197)
* Skip tests on libmamba 1.4.2 temporarily to workaround some test failures. Tracked by #186. (#187)

## 23.3.0 (2023-03-31)

### Enhancements

* Simplify exception parsing and enable new (experimental) conflict reports in `libmamba`. (#102 via #103, #160)
* Use `conda`'s `SubdirData` for all repodata fetching and caching. (#59, #68 via #65, #171)

### Bug fixes

* Disable lockfiles within libmambapy to conform with conda's behavior of not using them. (#120)
* Fix JSON serialization errors in some exceptions. (#140 via #142)
* Fix API breakage upstream: `SubdirData.cache_path_json` property changed from `str` to `PrefixPath`. Depend directly on `boltons.setutils.IndexedSet`. (#151)
* Updated bundled conda recipe and corresponding CI workflow. (#166)
* Bumped minimum conda version from 22.11.1 -> 23.3.0 due to change in boltons IndexedSet. (#170)
* Add workaround for `defaults::<pkg_name>` specs. (#173 via #172)

### Deprecations

* Python 3.7 is no longer supported. The minimum version is now 3.8. (#174)

### Other

* Change the build-system to `hatchling` + `hatch-cvs` for a `setuptools-scm`-like versioning setup. (#128 via #127)
* Add conda-forge based CI environments. (#133)
* Fix cache directory in flaky test. (#157)
* CI: Pin `minio` to `2023-03-13T19-46-17Z` to avoid breaking changes. (#159)
* Require `libmamba 1.4.1` or greater and remove unused code paths. (#165)

### Bug fixes

* Fix "Packages Not Found" error messages to be more accurate and informative. (#96 via #101)
* Ensure solves are deterministic and input order independent. (#75 via #111)
* Fix compatibility errors with newer conda versions >=23.1.0 since we are using an internal API SubdirData. (#118 via #119)

### Docs

* Mention expected versions and how to upgrade from experimental builds. (#89 via #93)

### Other

* CI: Add scheduled runs with self-reported issues. (#60 via #106)

## [22.12.0] - 2022-12-01

### Upgrade notice
To upgrade to `conda-libmamba-solver 22.12.0` please update to `conda 22.11.0` using the "classic" solver first:

```
$ CONDA_EXPERIMENTAL_SOLVER=classic conda install -n base conda=22.11.0
```

and then install a new version of conda-libmamba-solver:

```
$ CONDA_EXPERIMENTAL_SOLVER=classic conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver=22.12.0
```

Afterwards, please use the new `CONDA_SOLVER` environment variable and ``--solver`` as mentioned below.
